> SDLC Simulation - Portfolio Project

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository is created as part of my **7th semester assignment project** to simulate the full **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** through the development of a **personal portfolio website**.

The project follows all SDLC phases to demonstrate practical application of software engineering principles in a real-world scenario.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- To design and develop a GitHub-driven portfolio that dynamically fetches and displays user profile and repository data.  
- To document every phase of the SDLC: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.  
- To build a responsive, accessible, and performant web application without heavy dependencies.  
- To deploy the portfolio live on GitHub Pages for public accessibility.

### 📦 Breakdown by SDLC Phase

Here you go — the exact content without the header structure (no `###` or `####`) so you can embed it directly where needed:

**📦 Breakdown by SDLC Phase**

0. [Planning/](./0-Planning)
   - [project-overview.md](./0-Planning/project-overview.md): Describes project objectives, SDLC simulation scope, and academic context.
   - [system-architecture.md](./0-Planning/system-architecture.md): Defines project actors, overall system workflow, and UML diagrams illustrating SDLC and deployment flow.

1. [Requirements/](./1-Requirements)
   - [requirements.md](./1-Requirements/requirements.md): Documents all functional and non-functional requirements, API integration needs, priorities, and acceptance criteria.

2. [Design/](./2-Design)
   - [style-guide.md](./2-Design/style-guide.md): Visual design system including themes, responsiveness, Figma `.h2d` files, and `Github Runarok` UI mockups.

3. [Implementation/](./3-Implementation)
   - [index.html](./3-Implementation/index.html): Main HTML structure and entry point of the portfolio.
   - [css/](./3-Implementation/css): Modular styles for layout, themes, components, responsiveness, etc.
   - [js/](./3-Implementation/js): Structured JavaScript for GitHub API integration, theming, caching, and UI interaction.

4. [Testing/](./4-Testing)
   - [Test portfolio across devices.md](./4-Testing/Test%20portfolio%20across%20devices.md): Manual cross-device and browser testing methodology and results.
   - [test-cases.md](./4-Testing/test-cases.md): High-level test validations based on requirements.
   - [bug-report.md](./4-Testing/bug-report.md): Known bug regarding very small screen widths, documented and deferred by design.

5. [Deployment/](./5-Deployment)
   - [deployment.md](./5-Deployment/deployment.md): GitHub Pages deployment steps, branch setup, and screenshots (`Github Pages.png`).

6. [Maintenance/](./6-Maintenance)
   - [Maintenance.md](./6-Maintenance/Maintenance.md): Notes on codebase modularity, update strategy, and justifications for scoped limitations.

> **Pro Tip for Reviewers:**
> Each directory is mapped exactly to one SDLC phase. You can assess phase-specific artifacts just by navigating the folder structure — ideal for academic evaluation or technical review.
