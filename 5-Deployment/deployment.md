### After You Click Save:

- GitHub automatically builds and hosts your site.

## ðŸ”¸ Special Case: Personal Main Site (Main Portfolio or Site)

- Repository name: `username.github.io`  
  *(Replace `username` with your actual GitHub username)*
- Required page: `index.html`  
  *(This serves as the homepage of your personal site)*
- Site URL:  
  `https://username.github.io/`
- Important notes:
  - You can have **only one personal main site** like this per GitHub account.
  - This site acts as your **primary portfolio or personal homepage** on GitHub Pages.

## ðŸ“¦ Alternative Deployment Using `gh-pages` Branch

Another common approach to deploying GitHub Pages is via a dedicated branch named `gh-pages`. This is especially useful if you want to keep your deployment files separate from your main source code.

### How to Deploy Using `gh-pages` Branch:

1. Create a branch named `gh-pages` in your repository.
2. Build or place your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) in the root of this branch.
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, select the `gh-pages` branch and root (`/`) folder.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Your site will be live at:  
   `https://username.github.io/repo-name`  
   *(Replace `username` and `repo-name` accordingly)*
